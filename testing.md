User Testing

As part of user testing, I asked a friend of mine to review my app and give her feedback. 
I asked her to review both the positive and negative aspects of each page of the app.

The following is the prompt that I had given my user to receive their feedback about the app:

Please go through the application and offer your opinion on the functioning of each page/screen in the app. 
Please include your suggestions on how the application can be improved to better suit the users.
Write your comments for each of the pages as listed below:

Home:
I feel that the sections could be spaced out. 
It will make it more visually appealing.

Learn More:
I like how you try to mix the science and your game. 
Since you talk about harmful gases, maybe you could add some general information to give more context to the users.

Daily Dose of Science:
This page looks minimal and nice. 
I like the title of the page.

Suit Up:
This page looks interesting too. 
I like the helmets and how they work with your concept.

Start Game:
Maybe you could do something to let the user restart the game? 
I have to refresh each time I want to play a new game so doing that would make it even better.

Game Stats:
I like how you replicate a high score concept. 
But when I do not enter my name, it does not show any high score. Maybe you can change that.


Developer Response to user feedback:

I feel that the user has offered some constructive feedback.

In the home page, I have added more space between the elements that describe each page. 
This indeed makes the Home Page more appealing as stated by the user.

In the Learn More page, I have added more information about the gases. 
I also added a short introduction to connect the concept of the app and the scientific data together.
I feel that the feedback about this page is valid because it is a Learn more page and it needs to have more information than I had initially included.

In the game page, I have added the logic to allow the user to restart the game when the game is over. 
This way, the user can just restart the game instead of having to refresh the page. This was a very useful feedback from the user.

In the exploration statistics page, I added the logic to ask the user to play the game if he has not already done so. This will update the recent score. 
The app will also inform the user to enter their username if they haven't already done so. This will show the highest score.

Overall, I feel that the user feedback was very useful. It gave me a new perspective on the app. 
It highlighted some aspects of the app that I had missed. 
This was very helpful to me as a developer as it allowed me to enhance my application in a way that is appealing to my users.
